<p>Reuters <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-two-wheels-indias-ola-electric-feels-strains-success-2023-11-28/">reported that</a></strong> Bhavish Aggarwal, India&#8217;s answer to Elon Musk, is racing to roll out millions of electric scooters and speed his nation to a cleaner future. Some of his mechanics can&#8217;t keep up, though. Aggarwal&#8217;s Ola Electric, which he likens to Tesla in the West, is zipping towards a stock-market listing after going from zero to 338,000 e-scooter sales in about two years. The tech entrepreneur vows to banish the internal combustion engine (ICE) from India, where two-wheel vehicles rule the roads. </p>
